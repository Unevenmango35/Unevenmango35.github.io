I have always wanted to learn coding. The key word was "wanted". 
In reality, contrary to my statement, I never really have given enough efforts to build an actual application, or tried to reach out to a tech community. It always felt like it's "too late to start".

As a 90s kid growing up in Hong Kong, all I wanted to achieve was to get into college and then I could have fun (anything not academic related). There were no coding lessons in high school, and my computer homework assignment involves floppy disks. Needless to say, when I try to read the book "Introduction to Java" from library, I was not able to understand anything.

After graduating from college with a degree in textiles, I was following a traditional career path being a fashion buyer. I soon realize fixing up a collection of seasonal products, predicting what your markets would buy, managing buy budgets were not real skillsets. It was more about who you know and how you present the information. The most satisfying part of the job is to create different application or files to determine if certain products could bring profits.

My last company was a new brand selling lingerie in European markets, with factories in China. There are two different operating systems: one in maintaining inventory and invoicng customers, and one in manufacturing and shipping directly to the customers. It was difficult to pull any sales data or to manage replenishment because there were two different sets of data scattered in different formats and systems. It certainly was not helpful that the product range was huge (there are like 30 sizes in a bra, I know), markets were huge ( there were over 100 customers) and the company has no capital to get a centralized system. The team just has to replenish hundreds of thousands of products without an accurate data source. When I spent days grinding through the raw data, building a centralized data record sheet and forecast on replenishment using formulas on Excel, it was one of the satisfying moments I had. It also became my only duty of the day, which I only needed an hour to update and had other 7 hours to spare.

Since the quarantine started, reading through articles on Freecampcode and watching Youtubes on people changing career to coding make me realize how possible it is to switch career to tech. I still have that fear as the kid not able to understand the book, or it is too late for me to join the game. I joined Flatiron so I could let go of the fear a little more, and be focus more on doing what I always wanted: having a more sophisticated skillset to build applications. It's time to do it!
